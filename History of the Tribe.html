            <h2>What is the History of the Kikuyu Tribe?</h2> 
            <p>Tradition has it that the roots of the Kikuyu tribe, Kenya's largest ethnic group, are to be found in the legendary figure Gikuyu, who settled on the slopes of Mount Kenya with his wife, Mumbi, and their nine daughters-an ancestors of the Kikuyu clans. They were part of the greater Bantu migration that moved east from West Africa around the first millennium AD and eventually established a successful agricultural society in the central highlands. Their social organization was clan-based, with a council of elders managing it, which allowed cooperation and the resolution of conflicts. However, the coming of the British colonizers in the late 19th century drastically altered their mode of subsistence with resultant land dispossession, and the establishment of settler farms. This formed the basis for the Mau Mau Uprising in the 1950s, when Kikuyu warriors, as a last resort, rebelled against colonial rule to recover their lands and rights. The result was a gruesome war that heavily affected the community. When Kenya gained independence in 1963, with influential Kikuyu leader Jomo Kenyatta assuming the mantle of its first president, the tribe continued to pull strings in the nation's political arena. The Kikuyu have passed through countless episodes of ethnic tensions and land ownership conflicts in the modern decades; their ancestors' rich heritage remains fully relevant for their vital involvement in the building of modern Kenya.</p>
